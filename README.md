# Factorial Calculator

This project includes a simple Go application that calculates the factorial of a given number. It also provides test cases to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: Contains the implementation of the factorial function.
- `main_test.go`: Contains the test cases for verifying the correctness of the factorial function.
